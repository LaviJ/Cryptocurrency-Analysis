# Machine Learning Model

## Data for cryptocurrency forcasting
### Limitations of data volume
* Some datasets comprise a significant steady-state with segments of transient activity.  One example analyzed in https://nbviewer.org/github/LaviJ/Cryptocurrency-Analysis/blob/mlearn2/cardano_prediction_test.ipynb shows years of steady prices followed by one year of relatively heavier fluctuation.

* Is daily a highly enough resolved period length to represent forcastibility in crypto trade, that is, would hourly price data yield more accurate results?
